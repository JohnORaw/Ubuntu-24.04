# Remote Desktop

We normally do not use a desktop, especially in a data centre environment. However, there are edge cases. The path of least resistance is to use RDP as the client and there is a good script for enabling this [here](https://c-nergy.be/blog/?p=19814).

Also, there is a built in RDP client, you access it via Settings. This only works for me if I log on locally first....not great.
