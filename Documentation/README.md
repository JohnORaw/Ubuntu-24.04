# Introduction

These notes were originally written for Ubuntu 22.04. As they are updated, I will edit in place.

Any server being built as a VM should start with a minimum configuration. Only install what is needed for that use-case.

When building a Desktop, you will be offerred to install third-party drivers during installation. Do this, we have experienced problem with bare metal installs where we have not done this.
