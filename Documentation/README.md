# Introduction

These notes were originally written for Ubuntu 22.04. As they are updated, I will edit in place.

The GITBOOK of these notes can be found at&#x20;

The associated GITHUB account with scripts is [here](https://github.com/JohnORaw/Ubuntu-24.04/tree/main).

Any server being built as a VM should start with a minimum configuration. Only install what is needed for that use-case.

When building a Desktop, you will be offerred to install third-party drivers during installation. Do this, we have experienced problem with bare metal installs where we have not done this.
